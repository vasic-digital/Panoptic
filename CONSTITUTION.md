# Panoptic — Constitution

> **Status:** Active. This document is the project's authoritative
> rule set. When a rule here conflicts with `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
> or any guide, the Constitution wins.

## Mission

See README.md.

## Mandatory Standards

1. **Reproducibility:** every change is reproducible from a clean
   clone (`git clone <repo> && <project bootstrap>`); no hidden steps.
2. **Tests track behavior, not code:** test what the user-visible
   behavior is, not what the implementation looks like.
3. **No silent skips, no silent mocks above unit tests.**
4. **Conventional Commits** for all commits.
5. **SSH-only for git operations** (`git@…`); HTTPS prohibited.

## Numbered Rules

<!-- Rules are numbered CONST-NNN. New rules append. Removed rules
     keep their number with a "**Retired:** …" line. -->

<!-- BEGIN host-power-management addendum (CONST-033) -->

### CONST-033 — Host Power Management is Forbidden

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable. Applies to every project,
submodule, container entry point, build script, test, challenge, and
systemd unit shipped from this repository.

**Rule:** No code in this repository may invoke a host-level power-
state transition (suspend, hibernate, hybrid-sleep, suspend-then-
hibernate, poweroff, halt, reboot, kexec) on the host machine. This
includes — but is not limited to:

- `systemctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot,kexec}`
- `loginctl {suspend,hibernate,hybrid-sleep,suspend-then-hibernate,poweroff,halt,reboot}`
- `pm-{suspend,hibernate,suspend-hybrid}`
- `shutdown {-h,-r,-P,-H,now,--halt,--poweroff,--reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.login1.Manager.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep,SuspendThenHibernate,PowerOff,Reboot}`
- DBus calls to `org.freedesktop.UPower.{Suspend,Hibernate,HybridSleep}`
- `gsettings set ... sleep-inactive-{ac,battery}-type` to any value other than `'nothing'` or `'blank'`

**Why:** The host runs mission-critical parallel CLI-agent and
container workloads. On 2026-04-26 18:23:43 the host was auto-
suspended by the GDM greeter's idle policy mid-session, killing
HelixAgent and 41 dependent services. Recurring memory-pressure
SIGKILLs of `user@1000.service` (perceived as "logged out") have the
same outcome. Auto-suspend, hibernate, and any power-state transition
are unsafe for this host.

**Defence in depth (mandatory artifacts in every project):**
1. `scripts/host-power-management/install-host-suspend-guard.sh` —
   privileged installer, manual prereq, run once per host with sudo.
   Masks `sleep.target`, `suspend.target`, `hibernate.target`,
   `hybrid-sleep.target`; writes `AllowSuspend=no` drop-in; sets
   logind `IdleAction=ignore` and `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`.
2. `scripts/host-power-management/user_session_no_suspend_bootstrap.sh` —
   per-user, no-sudo defensive layer. Idempotent. Safe to source from
   `start.sh` / `setup.sh` / `bootstrap.sh`.
3. `scripts/host-power-management/check-no-suspend-calls.sh` —
   static scanner. Exits non-zero on any forbidden invocation.
4. `challenges/scripts/host_no_auto_suspend_challenge.sh` — asserts
   the running host's state matches layer-1 masking.
5. `challenges/scripts/no_suspend_calls_challenge.sh` — wraps the
   scanner as a challenge that runs in CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`.

**Enforcement:** Every project's CI / `run_all_challenges.sh`
equivalent MUST run both challenges (host state + source tree). A
violation in either channel blocks merge. Adding files to the
scanner's `EXCLUDE_PATHS` requires an explicit justification comment
identifying the non-host context.

**See also:** `docs/HOST_POWER_MANAGEMENT.md` for full background and
runbook.

## Definition of Done

A change is done when:

1. The code change is committed.
2. All project-level tests pass on a clean clone.
3. All challenges in `challenges/scripts/` pass on the running host.
4. Governance docs (`CONSTITUTION.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) are
   coherent with the change.

### Submodule Decoupling & Reusability — Mandatory

**Status:** Mandatory. Non-negotiable.

**Rule:** This repository is a **shared submodule** consumed by
multiple independent consumer projects. Its value depends on staying
**fully decoupled and reusable**. No change in this repository may
introduce coupling that breaks its standalone reusability for any
consumer.

**Prohibited inside this repository:**

1. Hardcoding any specific consumer project's name, paths, platform
   list, version strings, release-naming conventions, branding, or
   feature names.
2. `import` / dependency on any consumer-project namespace, package,
   or build coordinate.
3. Embedding consumer-project-specific governance, rule numbering, or
   release cadence into this repository's `CONSTITUTION.md` /
   `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`.
4. Assuming this repository is consumed by a particular CLI, build
   system, language toolchain version, or target architecture beyond
   what its public interface documents.

**Required inside this repository:**

1. All public surfaces (APIs, CLIs, configuration files, environment
   variables, scripts) MUST be expressed in terms of THIS repository's
   own domain — not any consumer's.
2. Governance MUST describe responsibilities and contract from THIS
   repository's perspective. Consumer projects appear as illustrative
   examples at most, never as load-bearing requirements.
3. Cross-project rules adopted from a consumer (such as a
   cross-platform impact mandate) MUST be phrased generically —
   "every consuming project's full platform matrix" — and never
   hardcode any single consumer's matrix.

**Why:** Repositories like this one have shipped changes in the past
where one consumer's platform list, feature names, or rule numbering
leaked into shared-repo governance — and then collided at merge time
with another consumer's parallel work, leaving the repository
unmergeable until manual conflict resolution stripped the
consumer-specific text back out. Decoupling is the only mechanism
that preserves this repository's value as shared infrastructure.

**Recursive scope:** any submodule this repository consumes inherits
the same decoupling+reusability rule. Third-party upstream submodules
that this repository merely vendors (e.g. open-source tools under a
`tools/opensource/` tree, if present) are explicitly out of scope —
we are not their owners.
